## **Pandemic Board Game Port**

During the Covid-19 Pandemic of Spring 2020, various browser-based ports of popular board games started making the rounds, 
so that one could play games over video conference with one's friend group while in lockdown. However my favorite board game, 
and one that felt deliciously ironic during this time, was missing from the list: Pandemic.

I decided creating my own port of the cooperative board game would be a good portfolio project to work on my budding Python 
and data science skills.
