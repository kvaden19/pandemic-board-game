## Pandemic Board Game Port

During the Covid-19 Pandemic of Spring 2020, various browser-based ports of popular board games started making the rounds, 
so that one could play games over video conference with one's friend group while in lockdown. However my favorite board game, 
and one that felt deliciously ironic during this time, was missing from the list: Pandemic.

I decided creating my own port of the cooperative board game would be a good portfolio project to work on my budding web development skill.

### TODOs:

#### Front-End:
** Mockup using Bulma
- Map
    - Each city will have "coordinates" which will fix its marker on the map (remember absolute, relative, etc positioning)
        - Hidden if nothing is there
        - Shown if markers, diseases, etc are there

#### Back-End:
** City Test (1 method)
- City Object
- Instantiate all the Cities
- Player Test (8 methods)
- Player Object
- Game setup script
- Gameplay script

##### Future Work:

###### Phase 2: Improvements
- Build 7 Player subclasses
- Build 5 Event subclasses
