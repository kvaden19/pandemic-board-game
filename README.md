Pandemic Board Game Port

During the Covid-19 Pandemic of Spring 2020, various 
browser-based ports of popular board games started making the
rounds, so that one could play games over video conference with
one's friend group while in lockdown. However my favorite
board game, and one that felt deliciously ironic during this
time, was missing from the list: Pandemic.

I decided creating my own port of the cooperative board game
would be a good portfolio project to work on my budding 
Python and data science skills.
